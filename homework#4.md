## Homework assignment #4
### 1. Consider only continuous attributes in data set 'ecoli.txt' to perform the following tasks.

* (a) Perform k-nearest neighbors to rank instances in which the probability for an instance to be class value '+' is calculated by the **distance-weighted voting scheme** given on page 226 of the textbook. Class value '+' can be 'imU', 'om', or 'omL', and the value of k can be 3, 4, 5, or 6.

* (b) Draw the ROC curve for each possible combination of k and the positive class value, and **compute the area under the curve.**

* (c) Discuss the result obtained in (b).

### 2. Identify the frequent itemsets for suffix 'd' by using FP-tree given in Fiqure 6.24. Show all necessary conditional FP-tree as the example given in Figure 6.27.
