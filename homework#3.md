## Homework assignment #3
### 1. Consider data set 'ecoli.txt' to perform the following tasks.

* (a) Perform naive Bayesian classifier to classify instances when continous attributes are assumed to be normally distributed or transformed by equal-width with ten bins. equal-frequency with ten bins, or the entropy-based discretization. The evaluation method is 5-fold cross validation.
### 2. When the number of folds equals the number of instances in a data set, it is called leave-one-out cross validation. Propose a method to compare the accuracies of two classification algorithms evaluated by leave-one-out cross validation.

### 3. As addressed in Dietterich (1998), the k accuracies obtained from k-fold cross validation for a data set are not independent because any pair of training sets are overlap.<br>
### Argue whether you agree with this statement or not.
